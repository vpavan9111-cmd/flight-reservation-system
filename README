# ✈️ Flight Reservation System

A simple Java console-based application that allows users to search for
flights, book reservations, and view their bookings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 How to Run the Application

### **Prerequisites**

-   Java **17** or higher\
-   Maven **3.8+**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **1. Build the project**

    mvn clean install

### **2. Run the application**

    mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.flight.Main"

### **3. Run tests**

    mvn test

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🛠️ Design Decisions

### **1. Layered Architecture**

The project is organized into: - **model** (Flight, Reservation) -
**service** (FlightService) - **ui** (Main console program) - **test**
(JUnit tests)

This separation improves readability, maintenance, and scalability.

### **2. In-Memory Data Storage**

Flights and reservations are stored in memory using lists.\
This reduces complexity and keeps the project aligned with the
assignment's requirement for a simple, self-contained system.

### **3. Input Validation**

To prevent crashes or invalid entries: - Customer names must contain
only alphabetic characters.\
- Seat numbers must be **positive integers**, preventing errors like:
`For input string: "10.0"`

Clear error messages guide the user when invalid input is entered.

### **4. Prevention of Overbooking**

A synchronized method in `Flight` ensures seat availability is updated
safely:

``` java
public synchronized boolean reserveSeats(int seats)
```

This avoids multiple reservations using the same seat count in
multi-thread scenarios.

### **5. Test Coverage**

JUnit 5 tests validate: - Searching flights - Booking reservations -
Edge cases (overbooking, invalid input) - Multiple reservations for a
customer

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌍 Real-Life Considerations

### **1. Thread Safety**

Even though this is a console app, real airline systems must prevent
overbooking.
The synchronized seat reservation method simulates this real behavior.

### **2. Input Validation**

In real systems, users enter unpredictable values.\
The application rejects: - Numeric names (e.g., `12345`) - Decimal or
negative seat inputs (e.g., `10.0`, `-5`) - Empty values

This ensures reliability and protects data integrity.

### **3. Scalability Awareness**

The architecture is intentionally designed so the system can later be
upgraded to: - A REST API using Spring Boot\
- A database-backed storage system\
- Authentication and user accounts\
- Real-time seat availability\
- Multi-user concurrent booking

### **4. Clean Separation of Concerns**

Real-world systems require maintainability.\
The clear boundaries between model, service, and UI layers make the
system easy to extend or integrate with larger platforms.
